<p>Our objective is to link you to the restaurants we partner with (“Partner Restaurants") and allow you to order Items for delivery (our “Service”). Where you order from a Partner Restaurant, Hungry Now acts as an agent on behalf of that Partner Restaurant to conclude your order from our Application and to manage your experience throughout the order process. Once you have placed an order, your Items will be delivered to you by Hungry Now (“Hungry Now Delivery”) or our Partner Restaurant (“Partner Delivery) (each a “Delivery”) depending on the Partner Restaurant you have selected. In some cases, the Partner Restaurant may be owned by or affiliated with us.
